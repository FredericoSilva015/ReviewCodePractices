# ReviewCodePractices
A common tab element, more importantly, a snapshot of my current code practices

## Simple and Raw
No bundling, no obfuscation, uglifycation nothing. Just a simple component and three files: HTML, JS, CSS

## A Standard Aproach
Meant to be used as a component, straight ES6, class based apraoch, because no bundling the JS is not broken down in multiple files, in reality each class would be disjointed from main file, being then bundled later on
